        <h3>Authenticator: 2FA & Passkey</h3>
        <p>Our "Authenticator: 2FA & Passkey" application is designed to help you securely manage multi-factor authentication for your online accounts.

        <h3>AI PDF Converter: Files to PDF</h3>
        <p>AI PDF Converter: Files to PDF allows you to effortlessly convert various file formats, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and images, into high-quality PDFs.

The app offers templates for different government regulations and allows easy printing or digital export.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  <strong>1. Data Collection</strong><br>
  <strong>Face Data Collection:</strong><br>
  The AI Passport Photo Maker App does <b>NOT</b> collect, store, or share any face data from users. When you upload a photo containing facial data to our server for processing (e.g., to create passport, ID, or visa-compliant photos), the image is used <b>solely</b> to generate the requested output. Neither the original photo nor the processed output is retained on our systems after delivery.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  <strong>2. Use of Data</strong><br>
  <strong>Purpose of Processing:</strong><br>
  Facial data in uploaded images is used <b>exclusively</b> to create compliant passport, ID, or visa photos. No facial data is analyzed for recognition, profiling, or any purpose beyond immediate photo processing.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  <strong>3. Data Sharing</strong><br>
  <strong>Third-Party Disclosure:</strong><br>
  We <b>do not</b> share facial data, original photos, or processed outputs with any third parties. All processing occurs on our secure servers, and no data is transmitted to external entities.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  <strong>4. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</strong><br>
  <strong>Server Retention:</strong> Both the original uploaded image and the processed photo are <b>permanently deleted</b> from our servers immediately after the task is completed and the output is delivered to your device.<br>
  <strong>Client App Retention:</strong> The original photo uploaded by you is automatically deleted from the appâ€™s local storage after processing. The final ID/passport photo is stored <b>only on your device</b> for your convenience and is subject to your control (you may delete it at any time).
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  <strong>5. Storage Location</strong><br>
  Facial data is <b>never stored</b> on our servers or databases. Processing occurs temporarily in memory during the photo-creation task, after which all data is irreversibly erased.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  <strong>6. Security Measures</strong><br>
  We employ industry-standard security measures to ensure the safety and confidentiality of data processing during image upload, processing, and deletion phases.
</p>
        
        <h3>Future Products</h3>
        <p>As we expand our product offerings, such as adding new products to the Apple App Store, we will update this privacy policy to reflect any new data collection and usage practices. Each new product will come with its own specific privacy details, ensuring transparency in how your data is managed.</p>
